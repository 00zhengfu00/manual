## Personal use
As with other wall tools, you need to configure a V2Ray server in a VPS outside a wall, then install the V2Ray client on a device that requires a wall over and then have smooth access to the Internet.

A V2Ray server can support multiple devices at the same time, using a different proxy protocol access.  At the same time, through reasonable configuration, V2Ray can identify and distinguish between the wall and outside the wall flow, the wall flow does not need to go through the wall around a circle and then come back.

## More than sharing
V2Ray also supports transit mode, such as you can configure a wall V2Ray server for multiple people at the same time, each user can use the browser or mobile phone comes with the proxy protocol to connect to the server.  And this V2Ray server and the wall of another server connected to achieve the purpose of over the wall.
