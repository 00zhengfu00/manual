V2Ray configuration file for the JSON format, if you are already familiar with the JSON format, you can skip this paragraph.
JSON, the full name [JavaScript Object Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), in short, Javascript
In the object (Object).  A JSON file contains a complete object, ending with curly brackets"{"and curly braces"}".
A JSON object contains a series of key-value pairs, a key is a string,

  "BoolValue": true,
  "ArrayValue": ["this", "is", "a", "string", "array"],

have to be aware of is:

1. Usually a key value behind the need for a comma ",", but if the key followed by a pair of brackets "}", then it must not be a comma.
