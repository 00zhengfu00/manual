HTTP/2 transport is added in V2Ray 3.17. It is based on standard HTTP/2, and can be proxies through other HTTP server, such as Nginx.

Configuration:

```javascript
{
  "host": ["v2ray.com"],
  "path": "/random/path"
}
```

Where:

* `host`: A string array. Each element is a domain. Client picks up a domain at random for each request. Server checks whether the domain in incoming request is in the list.
* `path`: HTTP path. Client and server must have the same value.

## Tips

* Both client and server must enable TLS for communication.
* This transport is currently in beta. It may have many bugs. It may also be changed in the future.
